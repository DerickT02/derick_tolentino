                <p>"I wonder what would happen if I could build an app"</p>

                <p>This was the quote 17-18 year old me said, because I thought building an app would make me a successful entrepreneur (still a work in progress). Who would've thought how far this quote would take me.</p>

                <p>I'm Derick Tolentino. I'm a aspiring software engineer, a self-employed freelance web developer, and a human being striving to improve myself and my programming craft.As an aspiring software engineer and entrepreneur, I'm always trying to find ways to solve problems wherever I'm at. Whether it be schoolwork when I'm stuck on a homework problem, or trying to fix bugs in my personal programming projects, I'm addicted to finding solutions, as well as spotting problems before they happen, something I've learned at my internship for DIYVersity.</p>

                <p>I always love learning new technologies. Currently I know technologies such as Javascript/Typescript, Python, React, Express.js, MongoDB, Firebase, Vite, and NextJS. It's tough to keep up, but I enjoy the challenge of learning something new.</p>
